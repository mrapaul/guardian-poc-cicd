## 🔄 GitHub Actions Status

The CI/CD pipeline is active and running:
- **CI Workflow**: Runs on pull requests
- **CD Workflow**: Runs on push to main branch
- **Current Status**: Waiting for DigitalOcean token configuration

## 📋 Next Steps

### To Complete DigitalOcean Deployment:

1. **Set DigitalOcean Token in GitHub**:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Using GitHub CLI
   gh secret set DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN --body "your-token-here"
   
   # Option 2: Via GitHub UI
   # Go to: Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   # Add secret: DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN
   ```

2. **Trigger Deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Push any change to trigger deployment
   git push origin main
   
   # Or manually trigger workflow
   gh workflow run cd.yml
   ```

3. **Direct DigitalOcean Deployment** (Alternative):
   ```bash
   # Set token
   export DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-token-here"
   
   # Run deployment script
   ./infrastructure/scripts/deploy.sh
   ```

## 🚀 Quick Commands

```bash
# Local development
docker-compose up -d          # Start services
docker-compose logs -f         # View logs
docker-compose down           # Stop services

# Deployment verification
./verify-deployment.sh        # Check setup

# GitHub deployment
./deploy-to-github.sh         # Deploy to GitHub

# Manual deployment
./infrastructure/scripts/deploy.sh  # Deploy to DigitalOcean
```

## 💰 Estimated Costs

DigitalOcean monthly costs:
- Container Registry: $5
- PostgreSQL: $15
- Redis: $15
- App Platform: $25-50
- **Total**: ~$60-85/month

## ✅ Success Criteria Met

1. ✅ Robust CI/CD pipeline established
2. ✅ GitHub Actions workflows created and tested
3. ✅ Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
4. ✅ Secure secrets management
5. ✅ Automated deployment pipeline
6. ✅ Local development environment
7. ✅ Comprehensive documentation

## 🎯 Final Status

The Guardian Security Platform CI/CD pipeline is fully implemented and ready for production deployment. The system is currently:

- **Running locally**: ✅ Verified
- **GitHub CI/CD**: ✅ Active
- **DigitalOcean**: ⏳ Awaiting token configuration

Once the DigitalOcean token is configured in GitHub Secrets, the platform will automatically deploy on the next push to the main branch.
